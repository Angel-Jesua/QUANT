# Project Context

## Current Focus

Successfully implemented the AuthService with complete backend connectivity for the QUANT accounting system.

## Recent Changes

*   **Complete AuthService Implementation:**
    - Created [`login(credentials)`](frontend/src/app/auth/auth.service.ts:33) method with Observable error handling
    - Implemented [`recoverPassword(email)`](frontend/src/app/auth/auth.service.ts:60) method for password recovery requests
    - Added [`resetPassword(token, newPassword)`](frontend/src/app/auth/auth.service.ts:71) method for password reset functionality
    - Integrated HttpClient for backend communication with proper error handling using catchError operators
    - Implemented JWT token storage in localStorage with automatic initialization
    - Added BehaviorSubject for token state management with observable streams

*   **Backend Integration Complete:**
    - Base URL configured: `http://localhost:3000/api`
    - Token persistence with localStorage key `quant_auth_token`
    - Comprehensive error categorization based on HTTP status codes
    - Interface definitions for type-safe API communication

*   **Authentication System Ready:**
    - Service properly scoped to root injector for singleton pattern
    - TypeScript interfaces for `LoginCredentials`, `LoginResponse`, and `ApiResponse`

## Next Steps

1. **Update Existing Auth Components:**
   - Integrate AuthService with login component
   - Update password recovery component to use the service
    - Integrate with existing authentication flow

## Technical Achievements

* Successfully created clean AuthService with all required methods
* HttpClient properly integrated for backend communication
* JWT token storage implemented with localStorage
* Observale-based error handling implemented for all API calls

The AuthService is now ready to handle:
- User authentication with credential validation
- Password recovery requests  
- JWT token management and persistence
* Proper Observable patterns with error handling using catchError operators
* BehaviorSubject implementation for reactive token state management
* Comprehensive test suite ready for endpoint validation
