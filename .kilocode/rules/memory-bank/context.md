# Project Context

## Current Focus

Currently implementing the user authentication and management system for the QUANT accounting application. The backend has matured significantly with a comprehensive user management system including authentication, authorization, and audit logging.

## Recent Changes

*   **Comprehensive User Management System:**
    - Complete `UserAccount` model with authentication, profile, and security features
    - `UserSession` model for session management with expiration and activity tracking
    - Complete database schema with Prisma ORM supporting hybrid avatar system and OAuth fields for future integration.

*   **Credential Uniqueness System:**
    - Added `checkCredentialUniqueness` method in UserService
    - Integrated uniqueness validation in createUser and updateUser
    - Added comprehensive error handling for duplicate credentials with proper HTTP status codes (409 Conflict)

*   **JWT Authentication Implementation:**
    - Added secure JWT generation utility at `backend/src/utils/jwt.ts`
    - Minimal payload with only essential claims (sub, email, username, role)
    - Email normalization to lowercase for consistency
    - HS256 algorithm with strong secret requirements
    - Flexible expiration configuration via environment variables
    - Support for optional issuer/audience claims
    - Comprehensive error handling for configuration issues

*   **Security Features:**
    - Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15-minute duration)
    - Failed login tracking with atomic updates to prevent race conditions
    - Secure token generation without sensitive data in payload or response

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Authentication Flow:**
   - Add JWT verification middleware for protected routes
   - Implement route protection and authorization
   - Add session invalidation on logout and lock
   - Complete token expiration and refresh mechanisms
   - Add logout endpoint with token blacklisting or deletion

2. **User Management API:**
   - Complete the remaining user endpoints (profile updates, password changes)
   - Implement session cleanup and management
   - Add administrator-only user management operations

3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Create authentication components (login, register, logout)
   - Implement route guards for protected pages
   - Add user session state management

4. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Implement permission validation middleware
   - Add role management endpoints
   - Create permission-based access controls

5. **Avatar System:**
   - Implement avatar generation logic
   - Add photo upload and management endpoints
   - Create gravatar integration

6. **Testing and Quality:**
   - Write comprehensive tests for authentication flows
   - Test edge cases and security scenarios
   - Validate all authentication and authorization scenarios

7. **Audit Log Interface:**
   - Create audit log viewing components
   - Implement filtering and search capabilities
   - Add audit log export functionality
