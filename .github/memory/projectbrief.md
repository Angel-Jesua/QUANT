# Project Brief: QUANT

**QUANT** is a full-stack application with a backend and a frontend.

## Backend

The backend is a TypeScript-based API built with Node.js. It uses Express for routing and Prisma as an ORM for database interactions. The database schema includes models for users, accounts, clients, and currencies. Authentication is handled using JWT. The backend has a structured modular design, with separate modules for different features like `account`, `auth`, `client`, `currency`, and `user`. Testing is set up with Jest.

## Frontend

The frontend is an Angular application. It includes components for user authentication (login, password recovery, password reset) and an animated background. The application has a standard Angular project structure with `app` and `assets` folders. It is configured with `angular.json` and `tsconfig.json`.
