# Product Context: QUANT

## Problem Domain

The QUANT application appears to be a financial services platform. Based on the backend API and database schema, it deals with concepts like:

*   **Users:** The system has a robust user authentication and management system.
*   **Clients:** There is a distinction between users and clients, suggesting that users may manage client data.
*   **Accounts:** The presence of an `account` module suggests that clients or users have accounts.
*   **Currencies:** A dedicated `currency` module points to handling of different currencies, a common feature in financial applications.

## User Experience Goals

The frontend is an Angular single-page application (SPA). The presence of components for login, password recovery, and password reset indicates a focus on a standard and user-friendly authentication flow. The `animated-background` component suggests an effort to create a visually engaging user interface. The overall goal is likely to provide a secure and intuitive web interface for users to interact with the financial data and services offered by the backend.
