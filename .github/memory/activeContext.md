## Current Focus

The last command run in the terminal was `npm start` in the `frontend` directory, which failed. This suggests that the current focus of development is on the frontend application. The error indicates a problem with starting the Angular development server.

## Next Steps

The immediate next step should be to diagnose and fix the error preventing the frontend application from starting. This could involve:

1.  Checking the `package.json` in the `frontend` directory for the `start` script.
2.  Ensuring all frontend dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.
3.  Reviewing the error output from the `npm start` command for specific clues about the problem.

Once the frontend is running, the next logical step would be to continue development on the frontend, possibly integrating it with the backend API.
